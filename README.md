# Spotify-Case-Study
## INTRODUCTION

Spotify, founded in 2006 by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, has revolutionized music consumption through its innovative music streaming platform. With over 400 million active users worldwide, Spotify delivers a highly personalized and engaging listening experience. The platform combines a vast library of songs and podcasts with intelligent features like music recommendations, social sharing, and offline listening, reshaping how users discover and enjoy audio content.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
In today’s digital landscape, users face several challenges with music streaming platforms: difficulty in discovering new music amidst overwhelming choices, lack of social connectivity in music consumption, and limited access to content without constant internet connectivity. These issues hinder user experience and engagement in digital music ecosystems.

## PROJECT SUMMARY

This project analyzes how Spotify addresses critical user challenges through its product features and system design. The platform solves the problem of music discovery using algorithm-driven recommendations such as “Discover Weekly” and “Release Radar.” It enhances social engagement through collaborative playlists and profile sharing, and ensures uninterrupted access by offering offline music downloads for premium users. Furthermore, a comprehensive schema design was developed to model key entities such as users, playlists, tracks, and followers, representing the underlying data infrastructure that supports Spotify’s dynamic features.

## CONCLUSION

Spotify’s success stems from its strategic focus on solving real-world problems in music streaming with user-centric innovation. By enhancing music discovery, enabling social interaction, and ensuring offline accessibility, Spotify delivers a superior user experience. The database schema outlined in this project offers a foundational understanding of how the platform manages complex data relationships to support its scalable and engaging service.
